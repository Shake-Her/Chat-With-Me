# Chat-With-Me

> Abstract : Chatting is a method of using technology to bring people and ideas together despite of the geographical barriers. 
> The technology has been available for years but the acceptance was quite recent. Our project is an example of a chat server. 
> It is made up of two applications - the client application, which runs on the userâ€™s web browser and server application, 
> runs on any hosting servers on the network. To start the chatting, client should get connected to server where they can do private and group chat. 
> NOTE: PASSWORD AND DATA will be encrypted as well using JWT module so our app is secure also.
